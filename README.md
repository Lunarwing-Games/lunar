Welcome to the *canonical* repository for **Lunar**, the in-house game development framework used by [Lunarwing Games](https://github.com/Lunarwing-Games).  
Lunar is written in modern C++. 

While optimized for **2D development** by default, Lunar is capable of **3D rendering** for games development.

## Features

- Modular and lightweight C++ framework
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- 2D rendering API built on top of modern graphics backends
- Input, audio, timing, and filesystem utilities
- Extendable component system
- Minimal external dependencies
- Doxygen-powered documentation system

## How to Build (Source + Docs)
<!-- Docs use Doxygen, since that's fast and really good for organizing -->

> [!NOTE]
> You may need to change some of the directories coded into the `CMakeLists.txt` file! It expects the Steamworks SDK (not available through Lunar) to be at the users HOME directory. You may need to change that to fit your environment!

**Source Code:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lunarwing-Games/lunar.git
cd lunar
cmake -S . -B build -G (generator) (misc flags)
```

**Documentation:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lunarwing-Games/lunar.git
cd lunar
doxygen Doxyfile
```
