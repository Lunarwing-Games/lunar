Welcome to the *canonical* repository for **Lunar**, the in-house game development framework used by [Lunarwing Games](https://github.com/Lunarwing-Games).  
Lunar is written in modern C++ and supports optional **Lua scripting** for game logic.  

While optimized for **2D development** by default, Lunar is capable of **3D rendering** and general-purpose multimedia applications.

## Features

- Modular and lightweight C++ framework
- Lua integration for flexible runtime scripting
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- 2D rendering API built on top of modern graphics backends
- Input, audio, timing, and filesystem utilities
- Extendable component system
- Minimal external dependencies
- Doxygen-powered documentation system

## How to Build (Source + Docs)
<!-- Docs use Doxygen, since that's fast and really good for organizing -->

**Source Code:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lunarwing-Games/lunar.git
cd lunar
cmake -S . -B build -G (generator) (misc flags)
```

**Documentation:**
```bash

```
